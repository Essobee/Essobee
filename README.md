### Have to start somewhere... 
Sep. '22
I'm just starting to learn programming as of Aug '22.  I'm starting with Python, though I'm alsoo exploring networking and network security, 
as pentesting or red teaming down the road is another possible interest.  As I'm self learning, I'm going to keep track here of what courses
I'm spending my time with.  I don't imagine I'll need to review any of them, as if my code looks like crap, you'll know I didn't get too much 
from whatever course I "learned".  

Hopefully this will be an ever growing README, with tons of content showing my growth from knowing nothing, to being at least competent.  Cheers

Courses I'm currently participating in 
Udemy:
Learn Python Programming Masterclass
100 Days of Code: Python
